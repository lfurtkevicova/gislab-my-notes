You may be coming to :ref:`GIS.lab <about>` from another operating system, 
and we expect that you are probably 
familiar with browsing the Web, writing documents, sending email and doing other 
jobrelated tasks with your computer. Whether you’re somewhat experienced or 
completely new to computers, this documentation should be very useful for you.
Of course the more experience you have, the more quickly you’ll learn.  

In general, this documentation does not assume any computer experience on your 
part. We try to explain in detail what :ref:`GIS.lab <gislab>`, 
:ref:`GIS.lab Web <gislab-web>` and :ref:`GIS.lab Mobile <gislab-mobile>` 
are, and we even tell you how to install 
and how to use every of these pieces in the most efficient way.
